Here, let's assume that 3 points are awarded for a win, 1 for a tie, and 0 for a defeat. Use the `match` table to calculate the running total of points earned by the team \"Chelsea\" (team id 8455) in the season \"2014/2015\".\n    - The final output should have the match date, the points earned by Chelsea, and the running total.","metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","id":"0bd35286-78b4-4e97-a74a-6cd9ed61da84"},{"source":"## Available raw
